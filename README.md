The purpose of this exercise is to help you to write programs that can process information at
the bit level.
Instructions: Write a complete C++ program that will implement a Full Adder as it is described
in these sources:
The Full Adder must be implemented as function entitled Full_Adder. Full_Adder will
take in 2 vectors of type bool, as input parameters. Full_Adder will return a vector of
type bool. The 2 input parameters are the unsigned binary numbers that will be added.
The returned vector will be the summation of the 2 vector parameters.
2. The main function will call Full_Adder (directly or indirectly) with different argument
lists to demonstrate that the function works with different inputs.
3. Full_Adder must work with any possible vectors of type bool. This includes input
vectors of different sizes.
4. Output the results of Full_Adder to the Console Screen. Your results must match the
Sample Run below.
